    "2. Submit your work in the form of a Jupyter notebook via Canvas, before the deadline. Your notebook should not give errors when executed with `Run All`.\n",
    "3. Most of your answers will consist of code. Make sure your code is well structured, efficient and provided with comments where needed. These aspects will be taken into account in the grading of your work.\n",
    "4. Sometimes your are asked to explain your code or to motivate your choices. Please be concise and use your own words in answering those questions.\n",
    "5. You are allowed to work on the assignment in groups of 2 or 3 students and to submit together.\n",
    "6. Your work will be graded according to the following criteria: correctness of the solution, quality of the code (structure, efficiency) and quality of your arguments, reasoning and comments. For each exercise, you can earn 0, 1, 2 or 3 points. For some (larger) exercises this number is multiplied by a factor, which is explicitely mentioned in the exercises.\n",

    "## Description\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to investigate the relation between real-time Twitter sentiments about publicly listed companies and their stock prices. One can do this by using machine learning algorithms to interpret tweets addressed to a company (via the @username syntax) and categorize the sentiment of the tweet as positive, neutral or negative. Subsequently, the relation between the aggregate sentiment over a certain time period and fluctuations in the stock price can be analyzed."

    "The dataset `airline_twitter_sentiment.csv` consists of more than 14.000 tweets sent on 9 consecutive days in February 2015, all addressing one (or more) of the aforementioned airlines via the @username syntax. The text of the tweets can be found in the `text` column of the dataset. Furthermore, a machine learning algorithm has analyzed the content of the tweets and categorized the sentiment as positive, neutral or negative. This can be found in the `airline_sentiment` column. The machine learning algorithm also estimates the probability that it identified the correct sentiment, which is given in the `airline_sentiment:confidence` column. Another relevant column is called `tweet_created`, giving the time and day at which the tweet was sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to create for each airline a table with the number of positive, neutral and negative tweets for each hour during the 9 days for which we have data, and to extract some basic insights from the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: US Airways was integreted into American Airlines in October 2015. Since our dataset is from February 2015, we will consider them as separate airlines.)"

Before doing this, you need to decide on how to handle the Twitter sentiment data of non-trading days. One way of dealing with this is simply ignoring these days, but you may want to come up with a more advanced strategy. Motivate your decision and approach in a markdown cell."
